Test Data
=========

The file Trimer-13.50-3.00.gsd is included in the repository as a reference configuration ensuring
that there is consistency with the interface which allows for files generated with previous versions
to be read.

This file can be regenerated by running the script `recreate_intput.sh`. This script will run a
simulation to generate the simulation, which by design takes a long time. This is to generate a
configuration that is truly representative of an output file of a simulation. I am easily able to
generate initial configurations as part of the tests, so this is distinctly different from the
generated files.
