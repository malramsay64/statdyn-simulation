# Data Files

This contains the reference configurations for the crystal structures defined
within this package. The unit cell and molecule parameters are defined in the
comments at the end of the file. The last two lines of the file are for program
which created the structures.

The angles for the structures have been rotated $3\pi/2$ radians to convert the
definition of orientation in these figures to that which is used within this
module.
